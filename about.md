--------

I am a Full Professor of Biometrics at the Universidad Mayor in Santiago, Chile. My research interests are related to theoretical and applied statistics for quantitative analyses of biological data, emphasising ecological and natural resources phenomena.

My [educational background](./educa.md) involved moving from forest sciences to statistics and mathematical modelling. I have been fortunate enough to have met many [mentors](./mentors.md) in this long endeavour. Furthermore, I have established collaborative work with Chilean and foreign [colleagues](./collabora.md), strengthening my knowledge of different disciplines and problems.
