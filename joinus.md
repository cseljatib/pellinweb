## Come to work with us!

We are avid to work with people loving nature, ecology, and quantitative methods. Specially, we are seeking people interested in (1) forest ecology, tree phisiology, soil ecology to undertake research 
at our long-term plot network in temperate forests in Chile;
(2) developing quantitative models to contributing to understand tree allometry and forest structure and composition; 
 (3) data analysis and management; and (4) mathematical/statisitical modelling.

I have a deep commitment to diversity and inclusion. Concordantly, I especially welcome inquiries from students and postdocs from underrepresented groups.

__Post-doctoral positions__
Please check the [following call for a post-doctoral position](/2020-08-18-postDoc.md)

__Graduate students__
I am interested in advising graduate students whose research interests overlap with my own, but I am open to new topics where I could be useful too. We are especially interested in supporting graduate students. Please feel free to contact me. 

__Undergraduate students__
If you want to work in the field and/or working in computing analyses, you can drop me a line. We seek enthusiastic students aiming
to learn applied and basic research.
